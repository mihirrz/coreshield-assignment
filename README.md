**Processing Map Data with Metadata**

### **Steps in the Approach:**

#### **1. Data Loading and Parsing**
- Read the `location.json` and `metadata.json` files.
- Parse them into Python data structures using `json.load()`.
- Convert them into dictionary formats (`loc_dict` and `meta_dict`) for quick lookup based on `id`.

#### **2. Merging Data**
- Create a combined dataset (`merged_data`) by matching records using the `id` field.
- Identify locations with missing information (`incomplete_data` list) and log them for reporting.
- Ensure that both datasets are merged correctly by iterating over all unique `id` values.

#### **3. Data Analysis**
- Identify valid location points (entries having `latitude`, `longitude`, and `type`).
- Count the number of locations per type (e.g., restaurant, hotel, cafe).
- Compute the average rating for each location type.
- Determine the location with the highest number of reviews.

#### **4. Reporting and Insights Generation**
- Print summary statistics:
  - Total valid locations
  - Count of locations per type
  - Average ratings per type
  - Location with the highest number of reviews
- Display incomplete data records and highlight missing attributes.

#### **5. Code Optimization & Best Practices**
- Used Pythonâ€™s dictionary operations to optimize merging operations.
- Utilized `defaultdict` to streamline type-based aggregations.
- Implemented clear variable names and structured the code into functions for maintainability.
- Ensured proper file handling using `open()` and `close()` to prevent resource leaks.
- Used conditional checks to handle missing or inconsistent data.
